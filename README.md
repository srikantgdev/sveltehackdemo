#### Zone Clocks

```

#### Radial Calendar
```
To view monthly calendar in radial format. User can view calendar of different years selected,
and when <code>Today</code> is clicked, it shows the current month.
```

#### Todos
```
This uses the *svelte/store* feature. Initially couple of sample todos are displayed. When a user 
tries to delete a todo, there are to options in form of icons for `thumb-up` or `thumb-down`. 
This was thought of as an alternative to a confirmation dialog. [Remove All] button enables to 
remove all items.
